**Project Description:**
---
In this senior Capstone Design project, we will be developing a CubeSat to venture into Low Earth Orbit and gather data an radiation waves 
(Gamma rays and X-rays) while we are in orbit. This GitHub repo is for all of the software that will be developed for the constructed payload 
on the TES-22 and the various commands and features that were built into it.

**Libraries that are used:**
---
ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon - Version 6.21.4
  - This version of ArduinoJson will allow us to send our data with JSON packets for ease of use during the development and testing process.
